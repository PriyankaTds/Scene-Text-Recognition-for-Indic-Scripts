# Scene-Text-Recognition-for-Indic-Scripts
This project utilizes Vision Transformers and Focal Modulation Networks for Scene Text Recognition on 8 Indian Languages: Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil.
We have also investigated the utilization of "group structure" inherent in the Indic scripts for improving STR results on Indian Languages. 
We have recorded improvement on STR results on the IndicSTR12 test benchmark dataset in 7 out of 8 languages.
